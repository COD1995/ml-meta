      <h1>Chapter 7: Linear Programming and Reductions</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>7.1 An Introduction to Linear Programming</h2>
        <p>
          This chapter provides a comprehensive look at linear programming, a
          powerful tool for solving optimization problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Linear programming is presented as a method for solving optimization
          tasks where one must find the best possible outcome (e.g., maximizing
          profit or minimizing cost) given a set of constraints. Both the
          objective and the constraints must be linear functions.
        </p>

        <h3>Profit Maximization Example</h3>
        <p>
          A simple problem about a chocolatier deciding how much of two products
          to make is used to introduce the core concepts. The goal is to
          maximize profit, subject to linear constraints like demand and labor.
          The set of valid solutions forms a convex polygon, and the optimal
          solution is always found at one of its vertices. The
          <strong>simplex method</strong> is introduced as an algorithm that
          finds this optimal vertex by starting at one vertex and moving along
          edges to neighbors with better objective values until it can no longer
          improve.
        </p>

        <h3>Extending the Example</h3>
        <p>
          The problem is expanded to three dimensions, where the feasible region
          becomes a polyhedron, but the simplex method's logic of moving between
          vertices remains the same. This leads to the concept of
          <strong>duality</strong>, a key idea where a certificate of optimality
          can be found by creating a new linear program (the dual) whose
          solution provides a bound on the original (primal) problem's solution.
        </p>

        <h3>Further Applications</h3>
        <p>
          The chapter demonstrates the versatility of linear programming with
          two more examples: a complex
          <strong>production planning</strong> problem for a carpet company
          dealing with seasonal demand, and an
          <strong>optimum bandwidth allocation</strong> problem in a network.
          These examples show how to translate real-world problems into the
          formal language of variables, constraints, and objectives.
        </p>

        <h3>Reductions and Standard Form</h3>
        <p>
          The concept of a <strong>reduction</strong> is formalized, showing how
          an algorithm for one problem can be used to solve another. It's shown
          that all linear programs can be converted into a
          <strong>standard form</strong> (minimizing an objective, with equality
          constraints and non-negative variables) through simple
          transformations, which simplifies solving them.

        <h2>7.2 Flows in Networks</h2>
        <p>
          This section explores the <strong>maximum flow problem</strong>: how
          to ship the most material from a source node <em>s</em> to a sink node
          <em>t</em> in a network where edges have capacity limits.
        </p>

        <h3>LP Formulation and the Algorithm</h3>
        <p>
          This problem is a classic example of a linear program. The simplex
          algorithm, when applied to max-flow, has an intuitive interpretation:
          it repeatedly finds a path from <em>s</em> to <em>t</em> and pushes
          more flow along it. To handle cases where an early path choice might
          block a better one, the algorithm uses a
          <strong>residual graph</strong>. This graph represents the remaining
          capacity on edges and includes reverse edges that allow the algorithm
          to "undo" or cancel previous flow, enabling it to find the true
          optimal solution.
        </p>

        <h3>Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem</h3>
        <p>
          A powerful concept, the <strong>s-t cut</strong>, is introduced. A cut
          is a partition of the vertices into two sets, one containing
          <em>s</em> and the other <em>t</em>. The capacity of the cut is the
          total capacity of edges crossing from the <em>s</em> side to the
          <em>t</em> side, which provides an upper bound on any possible flow.
          The celebrated <strong>max-flow min-cut theorem</strong> states that
          the maximum possible flow is exactly equal to the capacity of the
          minimum possible cut. The algorithm automatically finds this minimum
          cut, which serves as a certificate of optimality.
        </p>

        <h2>7.3 Bipartite Matching</h2>
        <p>
          This section shows how to solve the problem of finding a
          <strong>perfect matching</strong> in a bipartite graph (for instance,
          pairing boys and girls who like each other). The problem is reduced to
          max-flow by constructing a special network. A key insight is that
          because max-flow with integer capacities yields an integer solution,
          the result of the reduction correctly corresponds to a valid matching.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>7.4 Duality</h2>
        <p>
          Duality is revisited as a general principle of linear programming. For
          any maximization LP (the primal), there is a corresponding
          minimization LP (the dual). A feasible solution to the dual provides a
          bound on the optimal value of the primal. The
          <strong>Duality Theorem</strong> states that their optimal values are,
          in fact, identical.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>7.5 Zero-Sum Games</h2>
        <p>
          Linear programming is applied to game theory, specifically two-player
          <strong>zero-sum games</strong>. By using
          <strong>mixed strategies</strong> (probabilities for choosing moves),
          players aim to optimize their expected payoff. A player's problem of
          finding their best defensive strategy can be formulated as a linear
          program. The problems for the maximizing and minimizing players turn
          out to be duals of each other, proving the famous
          <strong>min-max theorem</strong>: there is always an optimal mixed
          strategy for both players, and the expected outcome is the same
          regardless of which player "announces" their strategy first.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>7.6 The Simplex Algorithm</h2>
        <p>
          This section details the workings of the simplex algorithm in
          high-dimensional spaces.
        </p>

        <h3>Vertices and the Algorithm</h3>
        <p>
          In <em>n</em> dimensions, a <strong>vertex</strong> is a point defined
          by <em>n</em> tight inequality constraints, and
          <strong>neighbors</strong> are vertices that share <em>n-1</em> of
          these tight constraints. Simplex moves from vertex to vertex. At any
          vertex, it can transform the LP into a local coordinate system where
          that vertex is the origin. From the origin, it's easy to see if an
          improvement is possible and in which direction to move. This process
          repeats until no further improvement can be made.
        </p>

        <h3>Practical Issues and History</h3>
        <p>
          The chapter addresses loose ends like finding a starting vertex,
          handling degenerate vertices, and detecting when an LP is unbounded.
          Although simplex can take exponential time in the worst case, it is
          highly efficient in practice. The chapter also briefly mentions the
          history of other polynomial-time algorithms like the
          <strong>ellipsoid method</strong> and
          <strong>interior-point methods</strong>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>7.7 Postscript: Circuit Evaluation</h2>
        <p>
          The chapter concludes by showing the ultimate power of linear
          programming: any problem that can be solved in polynomial time can be
          reduced to it. This is demonstrated by reducing the
          <strong>CIRCUIT VALUE</strong> problem to a linear program. Since any
          polynomial-time algorithm can be described by a polynomial-size
          circuit, this implies that all problems in P reduce to linear
          programming.
