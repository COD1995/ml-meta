        <h1>Chapter 7: Linear Programming and Reductions</h1>

        <section>
          <h2>7.1 An Introduction to Linear Programming</h2>
          <p>
            This chapter provides a comprehensive look at linear programming, a
            powerful tool for solving optimization problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Linear programming is presented as a method for solving optimization
            tasks where one must find the best possible outcome (e.g.,
            maximizing profit or minimizing cost) given a set of constraints.
            Both the objective and the constraints must be linear functions.
          </p>

          <h3>Profit Maximization Example</h3>
          <p>
            A simple problem about a chocolatier deciding how much of two
            products to make is used to introduce the core concepts. The goal is
            to maximize profit, subject to linear constraints like demand and
            labor. The set of valid solutions forms a convex polygon, and the
            optimal solution is always found at one of its vertices. The
            <strong>simplex method</strong> is introduced as an algorithm that
            finds this optimal vertex by starting at one vertex and moving along
            edges to neighbors with better objective values until it can no
            longer improve.
          </p>

          <h3>Extending the Example</h3>
          <p>
            The problem is expanded to three dimensions, where the feasible
            region becomes a polyhedron, but the simplex method's logic of
            moving between vertices remains the same. This leads to the concept
            of <strong>duality</strong>, a key idea where a certificate of
            optimality can be found by creating a new linear program (the dual)
            whose solution provides a bound on the original (primal) problem's
            solution.
          </p>

          <h3>Further Applications</h3>
          <p>
            The chapter demonstrates the versatility of linear programming with
            two more examples: a complex
            <strong>production planning</strong> problem for a carpet company
            dealing with seasonal demand, and an
            <strong>optimum bandwidth allocation</strong> problem in a network.
            These examples show how to translate real-world problems into the
            formal language of variables, constraints, and objectives.
          </p>

          <h3>Reductions and Standard Form</h3>
          <p>
            The concept of a <strong>reduction</strong> is formalized, showing
            how an algorithm for one problem can be used to solve another. It's
            shown that all linear programs can be converted into a
            <strong>standard form</strong> (minimizing an objective, with
            equality constraints and non-negative variables) through simple
            transformations, which simplifies solving them.

          <h2>7.2 Flows in Networks</h2>
          <p>
            This section explores the <strong>maximum flow problem</strong>: how
            to ship the most material from a source node <em>s</em> to a sink
            node <em>t</em> in a network where edges have capacity limits.
          </p>

          <h3>LP Formulation and the Algorithm</h3>
          <p>
            This problem is a classic example of a linear program. The simplex
            algorithm, when applied to max-flow, has an intuitive
            interpretation: it repeatedly finds a path from <em>s</em> to
            <em>t</em> and pushes more flow along it. To handle cases where an
            early path choice might block a better one, the algorithm uses a
            <strong>residual graph</strong>. This graph represents the remaining
            capacity on edges and includes reverse edges that allow the
            algorithm to "undo" or cancel previous flow, enabling it to find the
            true optimal solution.
          </p>

          <h3>Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem</h3>
          <p>
            A powerful concept, the <strong>s-t cut</strong>, is introduced. A
            cut is a partition of the vertices into two sets, one containing
            <em>s</em> and the other <em>t</em>. The capacity of the cut is the
            total capacity of edges crossing from the <em>s</em> side to the
            <em>t</em> side, which provides an upper bound on any possible flow.
            The celebrated <strong>max-flow min-cut theorem</strong> states that
            the maximum possible flow is exactly equal to the capacity of the
            minimum possible cut. The algorithm automatically finds this minimum
            cut, which serves as a certificate of optimality.
          </p>

          <h2>7.3 Bipartite Matching</h2>
          <p>
            This section shows how to solve the problem of finding a
            <strong>perfect matching</strong> in a bipartite graph (for
            instance, pairing boys and girls who like each other). The problem
            is reduced to max-flow by constructing a special network. A key
            insight is that because max-flow with integer capacities yields an
            integer solution, the result of the reduction correctly corresponds
            to a valid matching.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>7.4 Duality</h2>
          <p>
            Duality is revisited as a general principle of linear programming.
            For any maximization LP (the primal), there is a corresponding
            minimization LP (the dual). A feasible solution to the dual provides
            a bound on the optimal value of the primal. The
            <strong>Duality Theorem</strong> states that their optimal values
            are, in fact, identical.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>7.5 Zero-Sum Games</h2>
          <p>
            Linear programming is applied to game theory, specifically
            two-player
            <strong>zero-sum games</strong>. By using
            <strong>mixed strategies</strong> (probabilities for choosing
            moves), players aim to optimize their expected payoff. A player's
            problem of finding their best defensive strategy can be formulated
            as a linear program. The problems for the maximizing and minimizing
            players turn out to be duals of each other, proving the famous
            <strong>min-max theorem</strong>: there is always an optimal mixed
            strategy for both players, and the expected outcome is the same
            regardless of which player "announces" their strategy first.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>7.6 The Simplex Algorithm</h2>
          <p>
            This section details the workings of the simplex algorithm in
            high-dimensional spaces.
          </p>

          <h3>Vertices and the Algorithm</h3>
          <p>
            In <em>n</em> dimensions, a <strong>vertex</strong> is a point
            defined by <em>n</em> tight inequality constraints, and
            <strong>neighbors</strong> are vertices that share <em>n-1</em> of
            these tight constraints. Simplex moves from vertex to vertex. At any
            vertex, it can transform the LP into a local coordinate system where
            that vertex is the origin. From the origin, it's easy to see if an
            improvement is possible and in which direction to move. This process
            repeats until no further improvement can be made.
          </p>

          <h3>Practical Issues and History</h3>
          <p>
            The chapter addresses loose ends like finding a starting vertex,
            handling degenerate vertices, and detecting when an LP is unbounded.
            Although simplex can take exponential time in the worst case, it is
            highly efficient in practice. The chapter also briefly mentions the
            history of other polynomial-time algorithms like the
            <strong>ellipsoid method</strong> and
            <strong>interior-point methods</strong>.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>7.7 Postscript: Circuit Evaluation</h2>
          <p>
            The chapter concludes by showing the ultimate power of linear
            programming: any problem that can be solved in polynomial time can
            be reduced to it. This is demonstrated by reducing the
            <strong>CIRCUIT VALUE</strong> problem to a linear program. Since
            any polynomial-time algorithm can be described by a polynomial-size
            circuit, this implies that all problems in P reduce to linear
            programming.
