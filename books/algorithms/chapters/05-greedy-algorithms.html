                This chapter introduces a powerful and intuitive algorithmic
                strategy: the <strong>greedy algorithm</strong>. The opening
                paragraph uses a great analogy to explain the core concept. Some
                problems, like chess, require deep, long-term planning. A move
                that looks good now might lead to disaster later. But other
                problems are more like Scrabble, where playing the
                highest-scoring word you can find right now is often a very good
                strategy. Greedy algorithms operate like that Scrabble player.

                  that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. Although
                  such an approach can be disastrous for some computational
                  tasks, there are many for which it is optimal. Our first

                A greedy algorithm builds a solution step-by-step. At each step,
                it makes a "myopic" choice—the one that seems best at that exact
                moment, without considering the future consequences. This "take
                the best thing you can get right now" approach is simple and
                fast. While this strategy can fail spectacularly for complex
                problems (like our chess example), this chapter will explore
                several important problems where it surprisingly leads to the
                perfect, optimal solution.

                Let's start with a classic problem that feels very practical.
                Imagine you need to connect a set of computers (or houses, or
                cities) with physical cables. Each potential connection has a
                cost. Your goal is to connect everything together, directly or
                indirectly, while spending the least amount of money possible.
                This is the
                <strong>Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)</strong> problem, a perfect
                candidate for a greedy approach.

                  >One immediate observation is that the optimal set of edges
                  cannot contain a cycle, because removing an edge from this
                  cycle would reduce the cost without compromising
                  connectivity... So the solution must be connected and acyclic:
                  undirected graphs of this kind are called trees. The
                  particular tree we want is the one with minimum total weight,
                  known as the minimum spanning tree.</em

            <div class="explanation-text">
              <p>
                Right away, we can establish a rule: the cheapest network will
                never contain a cycle (like a path from computer A to B to C and
                back to A). Why? Because you could always remove one edge from
                the cycle to save money, and all the computers would still be
                connected. A graph that is connected and has no cycles is called
                a <strong>tree</strong>. So, the problem boils down to finding
                the tree that "spans" (connects) all the nodes and has the
                minimum possible total edge weight.

                One famous greedy algorithm for MST is
                <strong>Kruskal's algorithm</strong>. Its strategy is incredibly
                simple. First, sort all possible connections (edges) from
                cheapest to most expensive. Then, go down the list and add each
                edge to your network, with one condition: skip any edge that
                would create a cycle. You keep adding the cheapest available
                edges until all the nodes are connected. This is perfectly
                greedy—at every step, you pick the cheapest option available
                that doesn't mess things up.

                  are broken arbitrarily)... The first two succeed, but the
                  third, B − D, would produce a cycle if added. So we ignore it
                  and move along. The final result is a tree with cost 14, the
                  minimum possible. The correctness of Kruskal’s method follows
                  from a certain cut property, which is general enough to also
                  justify a whole slew of other minimum spanning tree
                  algorithms.</em

                Walking through an example makes Kruskal's algorithm clear. As
                you add the cheapest edges one by one, you'll eventually try to
                add an edge that connects two nodes already in the same
                connected group, which would form a cycle. The algorithm simply
                rejects this edge and moves to the next one on the list.
                Amazingly, this simple greedy process is guaranteed to produce a
                minimum spanning tree. The reason *why* it works is due to a
                fundamental principle called the "cut property," which we'll see
                next.

                  of G = (V, E). Pick any subset of nodes S for which X does not
                  cross between S and V − S, and let e be the lightest edge

                The <strong>cut property</strong> is the theoretical backbone
                for greedy MST algorithms. Imagine you divide all the nodes in
                your graph into two teams, Group S and Group V-S (this is called
                a "cut"). Now, look at all the edges that cross between the two
                teams. The cut property guarantees that the single cheapest edge
                that connects Group S to Group V-S *must* be part of some
                minimum spanning tree. This is a powerful, universal rule for
                safely adding an edge to your growing MST.

                  different MST T′ containing X ∪ {e} by altering T slightly,
                  changing just one of its edges... If we now remove this edge,
                  we are left with T′ = T ∪ {e} − {e′}, which we will show to be

                Why is the cut property true? The proof is a classic "exchange
                argument." Suppose some MST (call it T) *doesn't* include the
                cheapest crossing edge, `e`. If you add `e` to T, you create a
                cycle. This cycle must contain at least one other edge, `e'`,
                that also crosses the cut. Since `e` is the cheapest crossing
                edge, its cost is less than or equal to the cost of `e'`. If you
                now remove `e'` and keep `e`, you get a new tree that is just as
                cheap, or cheaper. Therefore, it's always safe to include the

                Kruskal's algorithm works because it perfectly follows the cut
                property. At each step, the graph consists of several
                disconnected "islands" of nodes. The algorithm picks the
                cheapest edge overall that connects two different islands. This
                is, by definition, the lightest edge across the cut separating
                one island from the rest of the graph. To implement this
                efficiently, we need a special data structure—the
                <strong>union-find</strong> or
                <strong>disjoint-set</strong> data structure—that can quickly
                tell us if two nodes are in the same island (`find`) and merge
                two islands into one (`union`).

                <strong>Prim's algorithm</strong> is another greedy approach
                that also relies on the cut property. But instead of building a
                forest of components like Kruskal's, Prim's grows a single tree.
                It starts with an arbitrary node and, at each step, adds the
                cheapest edge that connects a node *inside* the tree to a node
                *outside* the tree. This process is repeated until all nodes are
                in the tree. Its implementation looks almost exactly like
                Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm; the key difference is that
                it prioritizes the next cheapest *edge*, not the next shortest
                *path*.

                Now we switch from graphs to data compression. Imagine you have
                a long text file. The letter 'e' appears much more often than
                the letter 'z'. A standard encoding scheme, like ASCII, uses 8
                bits for every character, which seems wasteful.
                <strong>Huffman encoding</strong> is a famous greedy algorithm
                that solves this problem by creating a custom, variable-length
                binary code. The core idea is to use shorter codes for frequent
                characters and longer codes for rare ones, dramatically reducing
                the total file size.

                The algorithm's genius lies in its greedy strategy for building
                an optimal code tree from the bottom up. The core insight is
                that the two least frequent symbols should have the longest
                codewords and be siblings in the tree. The algorithm works by
                taking the two symbols (or subtrees) with the lowest
                frequencies, merging them into a new parent node (whose
                frequency is the sum of its children's), and treating this new
                node as a single object. This process is repeated, always
                merging the two lowest-frequency items, until only one tree
                remains. A priority queue is the perfect data structure for
                efficiently finding the two smallest items at each step.

                This section applies the greedy mindset to a problem in logic. A
                <strong>Horn formula</strong> is a special set of logical rules.
                These rules come in two flavors: 1) simple "if-then" statements,
                like "IF `a` is true AND `b` is true, THEN `c` must be true,"
                and 2) constraints that say "at least one of these variables
                must be false." The overall problem is to find a `true/false`
                assignment for all variables that doesn't violate any of these
                rules.

                The greedy algorithm for this is beautifully simple and can be
                described as "stingy." It starts by assuming every variable is
                <code>false</code>. It only flips a variable to
                <code>true</code> if a rule absolutely forces it to (for
                example, if a rule says `=> x`, then `x` must be true). It keeps
                applying these implications until no more variables can be
                forced to be true. Finally, it checks if this minimal `true`
                assignment violates any of the "at-least-one-is-false" rules. If
                it does, no solution is possible; otherwise, a satisfying
                assignment has been found. This remarkably efficient process is
                at the core of logic programming languages like Prolog.

                The final section introduces a famous and difficult problem
                called <strong>Set Cover</strong>. The school placement example
                makes it easy to grasp: you have a universe of items to be
                "covered" (the towns), and a collection of available sets (the
                group of towns covered by a school at a specific location). The
                goal is to pick the smallest number of sets possible that, when
                combined, cover every single item in the universe. Unlike the
                previous problems, there is no known efficient algorithm that
                guarantees a perfect solution for Set Cover.

                  scheme is not optimal! But luckily, it isn’t too far from
                  optimal. Claim: Suppose B contains n elements and that the

              <p>
                The most natural greedy strategy for Set Cover is to, at each
                step, choose the set that covers the largest number of currently
                uncovered items. It's a "most bang for your buck" approach. The
                book shows that this simple strategy is not always optimal.
                However—and this is a key idea in computer science—it's not
                terrible either. It's a provably good
                <strong>approximation algorithm</strong>. The number of sets it
                picks is guaranteed to be no more than about `log(n)` times the
                size of the true optimal solution, where `n` is the number of
                items to cover. For many hard problems, a provably good (but not
                perfect) approximation is the best we can hope for.
