                This paragraph defines the **Longest Increasing Subsequence
                (LIS)** problem. It's important to distinguish between a
                "substring" (which must be contiguous) and a "subsequence"
                (which can have gaps). For the sequence `5, 2, 8, 6`, the
                subsequence `2, 6` is valid because 2 appears before 6 in the
                original sequence. The goal is to find the longest such
                subsequence where the values are strictly increasing.

                  consecutive elements of the optimal solution. More generally,
                  to better understand the solution space, let's create a graph
                  of all permissible transitions: establish a node $i$ for each
                  element $a_{i}$, and add directed edges $(i, j)$ whenever it
                  is possible for $a_{i}$ and $a_{j}$ to be consecutive elements
                  in an increasing subsequence, that is, whenever $i < j$ and

                This is a crucial step in finding a solution: transforming the
                problem into a different domain. Here, the sequence problem is
                converted into a graph problem. Each number in the sequence
                becomes a node in a graph. A directed edge is drawn from node
                `i` to node `j` only if `j` can follow `i` in an increasing
                subsequence (meaning `j` appears after `i` in the sequence and
                has a larger value).

                This paragraph reveals the solution path. The graph we
                constructed is a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** because edges
                only point from smaller indices to larger ones, so it's
                impossible to form a cycle. Crucially, any path through this DAG
                corresponds exactly to a valid increasing subsequence.
                Therefore, the LIS problem has now been simplified to finding
                the **longest path in a DAG**‚Äîa well-understood graph problem.

                </li>
                <li>
                  We iterate from $j=1$ to $n$, calculating each $L(j)$ in
                  order.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To calculate $L(j)$, we look at all previous nodes $i$ that
                  could connect to $j$ (i.e., where $i < j$ and $a_i < a_j$). We
                  find the one that has the longest path ending at it (the
                  maximum $L(i)$ value).

                <li>
                  The length of the path to $j$ is then $1$ (for $j$ itself)
                  plus the length of the best path leading into it.

                <li>
                  The final answer is the maximum value in our `L` array, since

                  <strong>An ordering:</strong> We solve the subproblems in a

                  and so on.

                  <strong>A recurrence relation:</strong> To solve for a

                The runtime of this algorithm is analyzed. For each element $j$,
                we look at all previous elements $i < j$. In the worst case (a
                sorted array), every previous element is a valid predecessor.
                This results in a nested loop structure, giving a total runtime
                of $O(n^2)$. To reconstruct the actual subsequence (not just its
                length), we can use a `prev` array, just as in Dijkstra's
                algorithm. When we find the best predecessor `i` for `j`, we
                store it: `prev[j] = i`. After the `L` array is full, we can
                find the max value, start from that index, and follow the `prev`
                pointers backward to find the path.

                re-calculate the same subproblems an exponential number of

                  >Then why did recursion work so well with divide-and-conquer?
                  The key point is that in divide-and-conquer, a problem is
                  expressed in terms of subproblems that are substantially
                  smaller... In contrast, in a typical dynamic programming
                  formulation, a problem is reduced to subproblems that are only
                  slightly smaller... However, it turns out that most of these
                  nodes are repeats... Efficiency is therefore obtained by
                  explicitly enumerating the distinct subproblems and solving
                  them in the right order.</em

                This is a critical distinction between two major algorithmic
                paradigms:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Divide and Conquer (e.g., Mergesort):</strong> Works
                  well with recursion because it breaks a problem into a few,
                  *independent* subproblems that are much smaller (e.g., half
                  the size). The subproblems don't overlap.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Dynamic Programming (e.g., LIS):</strong> Is needed
                  when the subproblems are only slightly smaller (e.g., size
                  `n-1` for a problem of size `n`) and are heavily
                  *overlapping*. DP's power comes from using a table (or array)
                  to store the results of subproblems, ensuring each one is
                  calculated only once.
